## How to Use:

1. **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install cartoonify
    ```

2. **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    from cartoonify import cartoonify

    # Load an image
    input_image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
    image = cv2.imread(input_image_path)

    # Cartoonify the image
    cartoon_image = cartoonify(image)

    # Save the cartoonified image
    output_image_path = "path/to/save/cartoonified/image.jpg"
    cv2.imwrite(output_image_path, cartoon_image)
    ```

3. **Customization:**
   Experiment with the various parameters available in the `cartoonify` function to achieve the desired cartoon effect. Tweak settings such as `num_down`, `num_bilateral`, and more to fine-tune the output.
